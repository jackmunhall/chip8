# chip8
<h2> About </h2>
Wanted to try and make an emulator for a while. I tried the NES first but there are so many instructions (those addressing modes!) and hardware bugs that I decided on the chip8 instead as a first project. Technically an interpreter because emulation refers to software that emulates hardware, and the CHIP-8 programming language was never designed for any single piece of hardware specifically. Machines had chip 8 intepreters that would decode the instructions. Reinforced a lot of important computer architecture concepts and gave me a lot of appreciation for emulator work today. Hard to comprehend the complexity of emulating something like a PS3.
